This version is the final one which is the copy of the submitted version to the intranet

I had some issues while pushing my changes to GitHub, so I uploaded the final version to intranet.
However, as you said in the group I am pushing it on 25th April.

This version and intranet version is the same.

which contains the frontend app

1. Enter to the SocialMediaUI directory
2. Open terminal
